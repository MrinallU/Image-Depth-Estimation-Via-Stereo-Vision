Core of the algorithm

\subsection{Forward Projection Model}
\begin{remark}
    % paragraph paragraph name (end)
    Notes{\begin{enumerate}
        \item First to know how to map 2d to 3d, the traditional Forward Imaging model must be understood. 
        \item Go over the pinhole model, projection matrix (world to camera and camera to pixel) simplified to the projection formula
        \item We can use this simplified formula to derive the distance of the pixel in an image by using two cameras
        \item This new formula is ... , take note of the (xl-xr) which indicates the difference in pixel position from the left and right camera
            this is known as \textbf{disparity}
        \item However, in order to attain accurate disparity values from the two cameras, they must be calibrated

\section{Camera Calibration}

\subsection{Intrinsic matrix}
\begin{remark}
    % paragraph paragraph name (end)
    Notes{\begin{enumerate}
        \item  External Parameters: Position and Orientation of the camera with respect to the world coordinate frame\dots
        \item Internal Parameters: How the camera maps world points into the image coordinate frame.
        \item For the case of this program becuase of camera model was constructed to match an ideal model, we only need to make use of two variables the focal length and the distnce between the two cameras d.
        \item Use this as a good guide for the process: https://medium.com/swlh/i-see-you-computer-vision-fundamentals-64cc662d0b05. 
            Essentianlly use an mage of known geometry and rearange the original projection eqations to find both the fx anf fy
        \item In many modern cameras, the lenses are contructed in such a manner that pixel quality is maximized, however the shape of these lense
            can lead to singificant distortion in the image taken when compared to the true real world position. 
        \item There consists of two types of distortion \textbf{radial and tangential} 
        \item In the paper you can describe the correction equation as well as what they algo:ref
            but in the actual Implementation you would have to use the built in function since a custom distorition function is way to complex
            , have a custom intrinsic and extrinsic matrix computation tool though.

\section{Stereo Rectification}

\subsection{Window Based Algorithm}
\begin{remark}
    % paragraph paragraph name (end)
    Notes{\begin{enumerate}
        \item Now that the two cameras have been calibrated such that they are on a identical image plane wiht one another you can now find the disparity between pixels of the two images in order to find depth using the triangulation model. 
        \item One way this may be done is through a window based method, where we search for the object selected in one image the seocnd by creating a window and linearly searching for identical pixels on the second image. This method may be done efficiently due to camera calibration as the pixel range is on the same scan line. 
        \item We can explore other methods of stereo rectification if we have time as the computation is pretty simple. You would have the use
            a minimmum squared difference algorithm on the average intensity of the window.
